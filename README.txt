Neural Pathfinding Algorithm (NPA) is a project im currently developing with help from my friend. 
NPA aims to virtually recreate the neural pathways in your body (however, at the time of writing it is currently being designed for just forearm to fingertip)
It works by virtually mimicking the electric activity of several types of neurons involved in motor activity.
Then randomly making connections based on several factors,.
(a better explanation and the Algorithms formula is available here --> [add link to pdf])
